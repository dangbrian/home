		<h1>Uses of Nitrogen</h1>
		<p>Nitrogen is very important to the chemical industry because it is used to make nitric acid, nylon, fertilizers, explosives and dyes. In order to produce these products, nitrogen must first be reacted with hydrogen to produce ammonia(NH3+) and this is done by the Haber process. Every year 150 million tonnes of ammonia are produced in this way. Another use of nitrogen gas is to provide a nonreactive atmosphere. Large quantities of nitrogen are used in annealing stainless steel as well as other steel mill products. Annealing is a treatment that heats up metal or glass and cools it slowly to remove internal stresses and toughen it. Another use of nitrogen is when it is liquid nitrogen and it is often used as a refrigerant. It is used for storing eggs, sperm and other cells for reproductive technology and medical research. It can also be used to rapidly freeze foods, to help maintain moisture, colour, flavor and texture (<a href="http://www.rsc.org/periodic-table/element/7/nitrogen"> RSC, 2017).</a></p>
		<h1>The history of Nitrogen</h1>
		<p>Nitrogen was discovered in 1772 by the Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford (<a href="http://education.jlab.org/itselemental/ele007.html"> Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, 2017).</a></p>
		<h1>Facts about Nitrogen</h1>
		<p>Nitrogen was named after the Greek word nitron, for &ldquo;native soda,&rdquo; and genes for &ldquo;forming,&rdquo; nitrogen is the fifth most abundant element in the universe and constitutes 78 percent of Earth's air (<a href="http://www.livescience.com/28726-nitrogen.html"> Agata Blaszczak-Boxe, 2017).</a> Nitrogen is the 7th element on the periodic table right in between carbon and oxygen, it is also part of the 15th group and 2nd period. The element of Nitrogen is classified as a non-metal and it has a boiling point of -195.79 &deg;C (-320.42 &deg;F) and it's melting point is -210.1 &deg;C (-346.18 &deg;F) (<a href="https://www.webelements.com/nitrogen/"> Winter, 2017).</a></p>
		<h2>The Nitrogen Cycle</h2>
		<p>The nitrogen cycle, in which atmospheric nitrogen is converted into different organic compounds, is one the most crucial natural processes to sustain living organisms. During the cycle, bacteria in the soil process or &ldquo;fix&rdquo; atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, which plants need in order to grow. Other bacteria convert the ammonia into amino acids and proteins. Then animals eat the plants and consume the protein. Nitrogen compounds return to the soil through animal waste. Bacteria convert the waste nitrogen back to nitrogen gas, which returns to the atmosphere (<a href="http://www.livescience.com/28726-nitrogen.html"> Agata Blaszczak-Boxe, 2017).</a></p>
		<h1>Effects of Nitrogen</h1>
		<h2>Health Effects</h2>
		<p>Nitrates and nitrites are known to cause several health effects. These are the most common effects:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Reactions with haemoglobin in blood, causing the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood to decrease (nitrite)</li>
			<li>Decreased functioning of the thyroid gland (nitrate)</li>
			<li>Vitamin A shortages (nitrate)</li>
			<li>Fashioning of nitro amines, which are known as one of the most common causes of cancer (nitrates and nitrites)
		</ul>
		<p>But from a metabolic point of view, nitric oxide (NO) is much more important than nitrogen alone. In 1987, Salvador Moncada discovered that this was a vital body messenger for relaxing muscles, and today we know that it is involved in the cardiovascular system, the immune system, the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system. The enzyme that produces nitric oxide, called nitric oxide synthesis, is abundant in the brain. (<a href="http://www.lenntech.com/periodic/elements/n.htm"> Lenntech, 2017).</a></p>
		<h2>Environmental Effects</h2>
		<p>Humans have radically changed natural supplies of nitrates and nitrites. The main cause of the addition of nitrates and nitrites is the extensive use of fertilizers. Combustion processes can also enhance the nitrate and nitrite supplies, due to the emission of nitrogen oxides that can be converted to nitrates and nitrites in the environment. Nitrates and nitrites also form during chemical production and they are used as food conservers. This causes groundwater and surface water nitrogen concentration, and nitrogen in food to increase greatly. The addition of nitrogen bonds in the environment has various effects. Firstly, it can change the composition of species due to susceptibility of certain organisms to the consequences of nitrogen compounds. Secondly, mainly nitrite may cause various health effects in humans and animals. Food that is rich in nitrogen compounds can cause the oxygen transport of the blood to decrease, which can have serious consequences for cattle. High nitrogen uptake can cause problems in the thyroid gland and it can lead to vitamin A shortage. In the animal stomach and intestines nitrates can form nitroamines; dangerously carcinogenic compounds. (<a href="http://www.lenntech.com/periodic/elements/n.htm"> Lenntech, 2017).</a></p>
		<h1>More Facts about Nitrogen</h1>
		<p>Here are some more facts about Nitrogen (<a href="http://www.chemicool.com/elements/nitrogen.html"> Chemicool, 2017)</a>:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>About 2.5 percent of the weight of living organisms comes from nitrogen in organic molecules.</li>
			<li>Many of the molecules of life contain nitrogen. It is the fourth most abundant element in the human body.</li>
			<li>The nitrogen compound nitroglycerin can be used for relief of angina, a life threatening heart condition.</li>
			<li>Neptune’s satellite Triton has five mile high, nitrogen-powered geysers. Like Earth, Triton’s atmosphere is mainly nitrogen, but Triton is so cold the nitrogen sits on the surface as a rock-hard solid. The solid nitrogen allows the feeble light arriving from the sun to pass through it. Dark impurities in the nitrogen ice or in darker rocks below the ice warm up slightly in the sunlight, melting and vaporizing the solid nitrogen, which eventually breaks through the solid nitrogen as geysers which push ice particles one to five miles above Triton’s frozen surface.</li>	
			<li>In 1919, the world learned for the first time that atomic nuclei could be disintegrated. Ernest Rutherford reported that he had bombarded nitrogen gas with alpha-particles (helium nuclei) and found hydrogen was produced. (Further research by Patrick Blackett showed that the alpha particles had transmuted nitrogen-14 to oxygen-17 plus hydrogen.)</li>
			<li>The universe’s nitrogen was made, and is being made, by the CNO cycle in stars heavier than our sun.</li>
